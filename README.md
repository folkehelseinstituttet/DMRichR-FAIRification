# FAIRification of DMRichR Pipeline: Advancing Epigenetic Research on Environmental and Evolutionary Model Organisms

![Flowchart showing the process of adapting DMRichR for a new organism with an annotated genome, featuring interconnected boxes in yellow, light orange, dark orange, green, blue, and grey. Yellow boxes, such as 'BSgenome seed file,' 'CpG Islands (.txt),' and 'Cytosine Reports (.CpG),' represent user input files from a whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) experiment. Light orange boxes, including 'Genome (.fa/.fna/.fasta)' and 'Annotation File (.gff/.gtf),' represent input files related to the reference genome. Dark orange boxes, 'makeCGI' and 'eggNOG-mapper,' are intermediary tools used to process these inputs.
The light and dark orange inputs generate three custom packages—'Custom BSgenome,' 'Custom TxDb,' and 'Custom org.db'—shown in green, each fed by arrows from their corresponding input files. The green packages then flow into the blue box labeled 'Custom DMRichR,' which serves as the core analysis component. 'Custom DMRichR' also links to other blue boxes representing additional modified packages—'Custom dmseq,' 'Custom ChIPseeker,' and 'Custom annotatr'—with arrows showing data exchanges among them. The final output, depicted in grey as 'Outputs,' includes Blocks, DMRs, Smoothed Individual Methylation Values, and Heatmaps, summarizing the processed results from DMRichR.](https://github.com/wassimsalam01/DMRichR-FAIRification/blob/main/img/DMRichR%20Diagram.png)

Figure 1. Steps required to adapt DMRichR to a new organism with an annotated genome. *Yellow:* User input files (methylation calls) resulting from WGBS experiment; *Light-orange:* User input files with information on the reference genome; *Dark-orange:* Intermediary tools for producing input files; *Green:* Newly-computed species-specific packages; *Blue:* Modified versions of DMRichR and additional packages used within it; *Grey:* Results generated by DMRichR, which include Blocks, DMRs, Smoothed Individual Methylation Values, Heatmaps.

## Abstract

Bioinformatics tools often prioritize humans or human-related model organisms, overlooking the requirements of environmentally relevant species, which limits their use in ecological research. This gap is particularly challenging when implementing existing software, as inadequate documentation can delay the innovative use of environmental models, for modern risk assessment of chemicals that can cause aberration in methylation patterns. The establishment of fairness in ecological and evolutionary studies is already constrained by more limited resources in these fields of study, and an additional imbalance in tool availability further hinders comprehensive ecological research.

To address these gaps, we adapted the DMRichR package, a tool for epigenetic analysis, for use with custom, non-model genomes. As an example we here use the crustacean _Daphnia_, a keystone grazer in aquatic ecosystems. This adaptation involved the modification of specific code, computing three new species-specific packages (BSgenome, TxDb, and org.db), and computing a CpG islands track using the makeCGI package. Additional adjustments to the DMRichR package were also necessary to ensure proper functionality. The developed workflow shown in Fig. 1 can now be applied not only to different _Daphnia_ species that were previously unsupported, but also to any other species for which an annotated reference genome is available.
